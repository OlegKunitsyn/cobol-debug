### Requirements
A COBOL-syntax extension i.e. `bitlang.cobol`, `broadcommfd.cobol-language-support`, `rechinformatica.rech-editor-cobol` or `ibm.zopeneditor` installed. Otherwise, the breakpoints will be unavailable. 

Now you may choose between *local* and *container* execution environment. Or try both of them :)

#### Local
* GnuCOBOL `cobc` 2.2+ installed.
* GNU Debugger `gdb` 6.0+ installed.

#### Container
* [GnuCOBOL Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/olegkunitsyn/gnucobol) container up and running. 
The image includes GnuCOBOL,  GNU Debugger and all required dependencies needed to debug or execute your code. See an example below.

### Usage
When your `launch.json` config is set up, you can debug or execute your COBOL program. If you debug a Compilation Group (main- and sub- programs), you need to list sub-programs inside `group` property. Here's an example:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "COBOL debugger",
            "type": "gdb",
            "request": "launch",
            "target": "${file}",
            "targetargs": [],
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "gdbpath": "gdb",
            "cobcpath": "cobc",
            "cobcargs": ["-free", "-x"],
            "group": ["subsample.cbl", "subsubsample.cbl"],
            "coverage": false
        }
    ]
}
```

Pick `COBOL debugger` from the dropdown on the Debug pane in VS Code. Press the Play button or `F5` to debug or `Ctrl+F5` to execute.

The debugger uses C sourcecode generated by the compiler upon each debugging session. If the sourcemap isn't accurate or you see any other issues, please make a bug-report.

### Code coverage
You can estimate an execution flow of your COBOL program. 

![Coverage](coverage.png)

Set `coverage` property to `true` in your `launch.json` and start debugging session. Here's an example:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "COBOL debugger",
            "type": "gdb",
            "request": "launch",
            "target": "${file}",
            "targetargs": [],
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "gdbpath": "gdb",
            "cobcpath": "cobc",
            "cobcargs": ["-free", "-x"],
            "group": [],
            "coverage": true
        }
    ]
}
```

The extension decodes the code-coverage files in `gcov` format generated by the compiler.

### Docker
You may debug or execute your COBOL program inside [GnuCOBOL Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/olegkunitsyn/gnucobol) container. Start the container and share your working directory by `Ctrl+Shift+P` and command `GnuCOBOL Docker: start`, or in the terminal:
```bash
docker run -d -i --name gnucobol -w ${workspaceRoot} -v ${workspaceRoot}:${workspaceRoot} olegkunitsyn/gnucobol:3.1-dev
docker exec -i gnucobol cobc -V
docker exec -i gnucobol gdb -v
```

Add `container` property to your `launch.json` and start debugging session.
Here's an example:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "COBOL debugger",
            "type": "gdb",
            "request": "launch",
            "target": "${file}",
            "targetargs": [],
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "gdbpath": "gdb",
            "cobcpath": "cobc",
            "cobcargs": ["-free", "-x"],
            "group": [],
            "coverage": true,
            "container": "gnucobol"
        }
    ]
}
```

Stop the container by `Ctrl+Shift+P` and command `GnuCOBOL Docker: stop`, or in the terminal:
```bash
docker rm --force gnucobol
```

### Attaching to a running process
You may debug your COBOL program attaching to a running process. In order to achieve that, you have two options:

#### Local Process
Add `pid` property to your `launch.json` and start debugging session (you can use a input variable to help like the sample below). 
Here's an example:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "COBOL debugger attach",
            "type": "gdb",
            "request": "attach",
            "target": "${file}",
            "targetargs": [],
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "gdbpath": "gdb",
            "cobcpath": "cobc",
            "cobcargs": ["-free", "-x"],
            "group": [],
            "pid": "${input:pid}"
        }
    ],
    "inputs": [
        {
            "id": "pid",
            "type": "promptString",
            "description": "PID to attach"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Remote Debugger (GDBServer)
Add `remoteDebugger` property to your `launch.json`. 
Here's an example:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "COBOL debugger attach",
            "type": "gdb",
            "request": "attach",
            "target": "${file}",
            "targetargs": [],
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "gdbpath": "gdb",
            "cobcpath": "cobc",
            "cobcargs": ["-free", "-x"],
            "group": [],
            "remoteDebugger": "localhost:5555"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Roadmap
- Mac
- Unit testing

Your contribution is always welcome!

### Troubleshooting
Add `verbose` property to your `launch.json` and start debugging session. In `DEBUG CONSOLE` you will see complete communication log between `gdb` and VS Code. Here's an example:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "COBOL debugger",
            "type": "gdb",
            "request": "launch",
            "target": "${file}",
            "targetargs": [],
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "gdbpath": "gdb",
            "cobcpath": "cobc",
            "cobcargs": ["-free", "-x"],
            "group": [],
            "coverage": false,
            "verbose": true
        }
    ]
}
```

### Development
* Fork the repository.
* Clone it to your machine and open with VS Code.
* Install dependencies by `npm install` command in the terminal.
* Pick `Extension` from the dropdown on the Debug pane and press `F5`. This will open new VS Code instance with your cloned extension in debugging mode.
* Follow Requirements and Usage sections above.
* In the first VS Code instance you may put breakpoints to explore the functionality.
* Stop the second VS Code instance and implement your idea in TypeScript.
* Pick `Tests` from the dropdown on the Debug pane and press `F5`. Keep them green.
* Push your changes and create Pull Request to the original repository.
